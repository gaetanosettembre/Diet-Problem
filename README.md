# Diet-Problem
The goal of the diet problem is to select a set of foods that will satisfy a set of daily nutritional requirement at minimum cost. The problem is formulated as a linear program where the objective is to minimize cost and the constraints are to satisfy the specified nutritional requirements. The diet problem constraints typically regulate the number of calories and the amount of vitamins, minerals, fats, sodium, and cholesterol in the diet. While the mathematical formulation is simple, the solution may not be palatable! The nutritional requirements can be met without regard for taste or variety, so consider the output before digging into a meal from an "optimal" menu!
